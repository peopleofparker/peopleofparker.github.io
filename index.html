I see peace and solitude. Beyond our character in the center of the frame, we see the busy streets of Castlerock only a short drive from Parker. I was hiking the iconic ‘rock’ of Castle Rock when I saw this man. Above, there were several other young people. However, they were all on their phones snapping selfies, checking their social media, and laughing amongst themselves. One should certainly make time for this, but sometimes you must just stop and think. Stop and watch the cars drive below. Stop and think about the extraordinary chance that we even inhabit such a beautiful and perfect planet. </p>

Presuming he was the owner, I decided to strike up a conversation. He was indeed the owner, and I told him about the project that I was doing for English IV. He was happy for me to snap a quick image. He briefly talked about how much work it is to establish a business in Parker. Apparently, it is a very cutthroat area in regards to real estate, maintenance, and gaining attention for a specific niche. It made me reflect on something; new businesses pop up and disappear constantly in Parker. There are, however, a few that have stood in the very same place for several years. It is this grind, and endeavour of the human spirit, that forms the very economy of Parker.</p>

It appeared that a large crowd of people were headed to a show at the PACE center. I took this one candidly, not wanting to bother the group that seemed to be in a bit of a rush. It’s easy to think of our generation as one of disregard for the finer things in life, including fine arts. Here is, however, a group of young men and women on their way to view a theater performance. The oldest form of entertainment is still being enjoyed thousands of years after conception. To me, this is beautiful. Sure, there is definitely not a representation of all young men and women today, but arts seem to be still thriving.</p>

As a competitor myself, I felt several feelings that I have seldom felt before. The pressure of being in a competitive environment completely changes reasoning, heart rate, and general excitement levels. I found myself blanking on problems that I had studied for months. Deep down, inside of every human, is a love and desire for competition. It’s in our DNA, and it was required before the modern era. Competition, while not nearly as important as it was in the stone ages, never ceases to exhibit itself in important situations in life. This is something that the human race will never lose. Additionally, competition is something that Parker seems to thrive on. </p>

Trying to solve as many problems as possible in the shortest time can prove challenging. Additionally, several competitions display live scoreboards to indicate which teams are in the lead. This creates an extremely competitive atmosphere where only the most polished and well practiced teams prevail. In this image I see the bright minds of parking utilizing problem solving, algorithmic design, mathematical calculations, and data structures to complete the most efficient solution possible. Without this context, it may seem like a boring image. However, having done sports before, I can assure you that this is some of the most immense pressure a student can ever feel. </p>

Without the wise words of knowledgeable individuals, there would be no innovation, no learning, and no progress towards the human race. In this photo, a mentor makes a speech to many of the bright minds from schools around Parker, CO. Many of these students may not listen, and that’s just fine. The ones that do will learn a powerful and impactful lesson. One day, these students that listened will be giving a slightly different speech to the next generation of bright minds. </p>

Developing software requires design, planning, programming, and implementation. Mess up any of these steps along the way, the entire process is bricked. In this image, we can see a Legend High School student going through this exact process. While maybe disheartening, it is a completely necessary process. </p>

Like myself, he came into high school with an extremely counterintuitive ego problem. He had coded previously throughout his life, and thought that high school would be a breeze. After his first programming class, this turned out to be false. He learned the hard way that he wasn’t the coolest thing since sliced bread. This is a damaging realization certainly, but it is extremely necessary. It is important to remember that there is always someone better than you. </p>

You may find an extremely beautiful site that you otherwise never would have seen. This image was captured after a friend and I decided to do just this-- get lost.

Now, I’m always down to ride the titan; but at a certain point, I’ve had enough. After my fifth ride, I was pretty tuckered out. I looked over my shoulder to see that a student I had never seen before in my life had actually somehow harnessed some kind of superhuman strength to rip a support out of the bleachers and wave it around. This is the next generation, and honestly I could not be prouder.</p>
